# Practistics React Prototype

Recreating my Bootstrap-HTML-CSS + Jinja2 templating based website that I used for https://practistics.live with a React + Tailwind based approach. Raw components from ShadCN-UI customized for my use case. Self generated theme. 

This project implements the following:

- A basic react counter using state variables.

- A basic react message board, that consumes an api, and POSTs new messages to an api aswell. Stores all the POST-ed messages from the current session in the board.

- A web-app type SPA dashboard with a retractable side-bar.

- A detailed implementation of recharts to create dynamic graphs based on random data consumed from the mock-api.

- Click-able cards that open up modals with detailed data related to the card.

- Various different stunning dashboard components including a 2D match summary for valorant matches, sortable tables based on agent-pickrates and more.
